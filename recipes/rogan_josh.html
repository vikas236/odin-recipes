    <p>If you're looking for a rich stew that will wrap you up in a warm hug, a serving of rogan josh will definitely
        hit the spot. The name doesn't come from a man called Josh; instead, it provides a hint as to its preparation
        and flavor. According to Dawn, in Persian, rogan means clarified butter (or ghee) and josh refers to fiery heat,
        two characteristics of this dish. Also, in Hindi, rogan translates to the color red, which is a fair description
        of the vibrant curry. Nowadays, Taste Atlas indicates that rogan josh is typically associated with the Kashmiri
        region in northern India.

    <p>Aside from the two features that give this dish its name, let's dive into the other elements: Goat, or lamb, is
        simmered in a savory ghee-based gravy, which includes aromatic ingredients such as onions, garlic, ginger,
        spices (cinnamon, clove, cardamom), and yogurt as a thickener. Some regional variations incorporate tomato into
        the sauce, and the list of spices is flexible; however, Kashmiri chilis are often a mainstay (via Los Altos Town
        Crier). As the meat cooks, it becomes perfectly tender and flavorful, resulting in a delicious stew that
        requires little more than basmati rice or naan bread to be complete.
