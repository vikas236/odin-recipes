    <p>If you're finding it hard to load up on greens, palak paneer is the best way to get your fill. According to
        MasterClass, palak translates to spinach, and paneer is a semi-firm, fresh-pressed cheese. The result is a
        delicious combination that might make you consider pairing the two all the time. Paneer doesn't melt when
        heated; instead, it retains its cubed shape as it stews in the spinach, providing textural contrast. Aside from
        pureed spinach and fresh cheese, some cream, onion, ginger, garlic, and garam masala all contribute to the
        flavor and rich consistency. The spice profile can vary from kitchen to kitchen, making every palak paneer
        preparation distinct.

        MasterClass places the origin of this vegetarian dish in the Punjab region in northern India, noting that it is
        also called saag paneer, referring to the variety of leafy greens that can be used. According to Dawn, palak
        paneer has rural origins, typically prepared to nourish people working labor-intensive agricultural jobs. Thanks
        to the paneer, this dish makes a solid vegetarian main, especially with its typical accompaniments such as rice
        or bread. However, it's also the perfect green side dish for a meat main, or as part of a larger selection.
